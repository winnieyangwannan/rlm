      "1. Data Preprocessing\n",
      "- Input data loading method\n",
      "  - Train annotations loaded from CSV at /root/data/train.csv using pandas.read_csv.\n",
      "  - Training DICOM images read from /root/data/train/*.dicom and test DICOM images from /root/data/test/*.dicom.\n",
      "  - DICOMs are converted to 8-bit 3-channel JPEGs via dicom_to_jpeg (uses pydicom to read ds.pixel_array).\n",
      "- Missing value handling (method, columns affected)\n",
      "  - For annotations, rows with NaNs in bounding box columns [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max] are filtered out before label creation: ann_df = g[(g['class_id'] != 14) & (~g[['x_min','y_min','x_max','y_max']].isna().any(axis=1))].\n",
      "  - During label writing, an additional check skips any detection with NaNs in bbox coordinates.\n",
      "  - If an image has no valid annotations after filtering, an empty label file is written to avoid loader crashes.\n",
      "- Data cleaning steps (outlier removal, filtering, etc.)\n",
      "  - Pixel intensity clipping to percentiles [0.5, 99.5] to reduce outliers.\n",
      "  - DICOM RescaleSlope and RescaleIntercept applied when present.\n",
      "  - MONOCHROME1 images are inverted (arr = max - arr).\n",
      "  - Bounding boxes clamped to image boundaries and coordinates ordered properly through clamp_bbox; width/height in labels forced to at least 1 pixel before normalization.\n",
      "- Normalization/scaling (which columns, which method)\n",
      "  - Image arrays normalized to [0, 1] after clipping, then scaled to [0, 255] and cast to uint8.\n",
      "  - YOLO label coordinates normalized to [0, 1]: center-x, center-y, width, height.\n",
      "- Data type conversions\n",
      "  - DICOM pixel array cast to float32 for processing; final JPEG cast to uint8.\n",
      "  - Grayscale converted to 3-channel by stacking the single channel.\n",
      "  - YOLO labels written as text files in class cx cy w h (normalized) format.\n",
      "- Train/test split approach\n",
      "  - Image IDs are shuffled with a fixed SEED (default 42).\n",
      "  - Single holdout validation: first int(len(train_imgs) * VAL_SPLIT) images used for validation (default VAL_SPLIT=0.1), rest for training.\n",
      "  - No stratification or k-fold.\n",
      "- Other preprocessing steps\n",
      "  - Parallelized DICOM-to-JPEG conversion and label writing using multiprocessing.Pool with up to MAX_WORKERS.\n",
      "  - Builds Ultralytics data YAML (path, train/val text lists, nc, names) at /workspace/vinbig.yaml and writes train.txt/val.txt listing image paths.\n",
      "  - Skips class_id 14 (\"No finding\") in training labels and names.\n",
      "  - Caps considered training images via MAX_TRAIN_IMAGES env var (default 2000); development mode (FAST_DEV_RUN) further limits to DEV_TRAIN_IMAGES (default 400).\n",

      "\n",
      "5. Training Methodology\n",
      "- Cross-validation scheme (k-fold, stratified, time-series split, etc.)\n",
      "  - Single random holdout validation based on VAL_SPLIT; no k-fold or stratification.\n",
      "- Hyperparameter tuning approach (grid search, random search, Bayesian, manual)\n",
      "  - Not specified in code (fixed parameters and a single retry strategy on failure).\n",
      "- Training/validation split ratios\n",
      "  - VAL_SPLIT environment variable, default 0.1 (10% validation).\n",
      "- Early stopping criteria (if applicable)\n",
      "  - patience argument passed to YOLO.train (10 for main run, 5 for retry), enabling early stopping per Ultralytics’ internal logic.\n",
      "- Number of training epochs/iterations\n",
      "  - Default 30 epochs (or 1 in FAST_DEV_RUN). Retry uses half of EPOCHS with reduced imgsz/batch if initial training fails.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Evaluation & Submission\n",
      "- Final prediction method (mean, median, weighted average, etc.)\n",
      "  - Single-model inference using model.predict on test JPEGs with conf threshold CONF_THRES (default 0.1) and imgsz=IMG_SIZE; no ensembling or averaging.\n",
      "- Post-processing of predictions\n",
      "  - For each prediction: extract class, confidence, and xyxy; round to integers; clamp to minimum 1-pixel width/height and non-negative coordinates.\n",
      "  - If no predictions for an image, outputs a default \"No finding\" line: \"14 1.0 0 0 1 1\".\n",
      "  - Submission saved to /workspace/submission.csv with columns [image_id, PredictionString].\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Notable Implementation Details\n",
      "- Any unique approaches or novel techniques\n",
      "  - Robust DICOM preprocessing: applies RescaleSlope/Intercept, handles MONOCHROME1 inversion, and percentile clipping (0.5–99.5) to stabilize image dynamic range.\n",
      "  - Bounding box sanitation: clamps to image dimensions and enforces a minimum pixel size before normalization to YOLO format.\n",
      "  - Skips class 14 (\"No finding\") entirely during training (both in labels and class names), aligning the task with detecting abnormalities only.\n",
      "  - Fallback behaviors: writes empty label files for images with no valid annotations to prevent loader errors; if inference yields no boxes, emits a \"No finding\" prediction; on fatal errors, writes a dummy submission for all test images.\n",
      "- Computational considerations (GPU usage, runtime optimizations)\n",
      "  - Uses GPU (device=0) for training and inference.\n",
      "  - Parallelizes DICOM conversion for train and test using multiprocessing with configurable worker count.\n",
      "  - Limits training set size via MAX_TRAIN_IMAGES to control runtime (default 2000).\n",
      "  - Uses Ultralytics cache='disk' and reduces batch/imgsz on retry to handle memory constraints.\n",
      "  - Disables external experiment tracking (W&B) to avoid interruptions.\n",
      "  - Dependency isolation (/workspace/pydeps) and pip --no-deps installs to minimize environment conflicts; ensures compressed DICOM support via pylibjpeg.\n",
      "- Anything else significant to the solution's approach\n",
      "  - Builds a YOLO dataset YAML with explicit train/val lists (train.txt, val.txt) rather than directory-scanning.\n",
      "  - Model initialization prefers architecture YAML (e.g., yolov8n.yaml) and only attempts pretrained weights ('yolov8n.pt') as a last resort.\n",
      "  - Task correctly implemented as object detection (not classification) for chest X-rays.\n",

      "When you have a broken arm, radiologists help save the day—and the bone. These doctors diagnose and treat medical conditions using imaging techniques like CT and PET scans, MRIs, and, of course, X-rays. Yet, as it happens when working with such a wide variety of medical tools, radiologists face many daily challenges, perhaps the most difficult being the chest radiograph. The interpretation of chest X-rays can lead to medical misdiagnosis, even for the best practicing doctor. Computer-aided detection and diagnosis systems (CADe/CADx) would help reduce the pressure on doctors at metropolitan hospitals and improve diagnostic quality in rural areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing methods of interpreting chest X-ray images classify them into a list of findings. There is currently no specification of their locations on the image which sometimes leads to inexplicable results. A solution for localizing findings on chest X-ray images is needed for providing doctors with more meaningful diagnostic assistance.\n",

    "## IMPORTANT: Returning Your Final Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have completed your analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Store your complete final answer in a variable named exactly `final_answer`**\n",
    "2. **Before returning, verify the variable exists** by printing: `print(\"final_answer\" in dir())`\n",
    "3. **Return using exactly**: `FINAL_VAR(final_answer)`\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ Do NOT use a different variable name like `cleaned_final_output`, `result`, or `output`.\n",
    "⚠️ Do NOT call FINAL_VAR with a variable that doesn't exist - this will cause an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example pattern:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Build your final answer\n",
    "final_answer = \"Your complete analysis here...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify it exists before returning\n",
    "print(\"Variable 'final_answer' exists:\", \"final_answer\" in dir())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in your next response, use: FINAL_VAR(final_answer)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explicit Variable Naming**: Forces the model to use a specific, predictable variable name (`final_answer`)\n",
    "2. **Verification Step**: The `print(\"final_answer\" in dir())` check gives the model feedback before returning\n",
    "3. **Negative Examples**: Explicitly warns against common hallucination patterns like `cleaned_final_output`\n",
    "4. **Code Example**: Provides a concrete template the model can follow\n",
